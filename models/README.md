# Trained Models

Directory to place trained models for demo purpose.  

- The demo model (`./demo.h5`) is a slightly modified version of [this model](https://github.com/socathie/keras2circom/blob/main/models/best_practice.h5).
- We are using [keras2circom](https://github.com/socathie/keras2circom) as a way to convert model files into circom-compatible circuits.
- Follow the steps in keras2circom's [README](https://github.com/socathie/keras2circom#keras2circom) to convert ML models into circuits (the demo circuit generated from the demo model is `./circuits/demo-circuit.circom`).
